# Pomodoro to the Moon

I completed this project to improve my HTML, CSS and Javascript skills. 

The project is a Pomodoro Timer app, with some personal adjustments.

The user:

* Can set the timer of work;
* Can set the timer of break;
* Can reset the clock of the next timer;
* Will be advised when the timer stops;

And of course. The user can watch the tomato landing on the moon...
